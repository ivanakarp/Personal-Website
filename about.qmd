I am an undergraduate student currently studying Mathematics and Statistics at UCLA. In the past I have mostly applied my skills doing mathematical research in fields such as matroid and knot theory. More recently I have been working as a student researcher at a wind energy lab attempting to predict wind farm power and revenue generation under turbulent conditions. At present I am mostly interested in research on renewable energy and climate science.
