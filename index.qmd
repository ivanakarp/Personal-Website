## Wind Farm Simulation

I work as a student researcher under Chris Qin at WSU Vancouver. My work involves predicting the generated power and revenue of wind farms under variable turbulence and market conditions. I have presented some of my findings at the IEEE Big Data 2024 conference in Washington D.C. and am currently working on a journal paper version.

### Publications

Data-Driven Modeling of Wind Farm Power and Revenue Generation ([PDF](/Paper.pdf), [IEEE Xplore](https://xploreqa.ieee.org/document/10825628/metrics#metrics))

## Matroid Theory Research

I worked under Assistant Professor Federico Scavia researching the properties of [matroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid) and the Galois groups of their Tutte Polynomials.

## Petal Projection Visualizer

Created a program for visualizing and checking the validity of [petal projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petal_projection), a construct in knot theory.
